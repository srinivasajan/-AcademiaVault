# Repository Purpose

This repository is mainly for **nonsense, experiments, random ideas, and testing things out**.

There is no fixed roadmap, no stable product, and no guarantee that anything here will work or make sense.  
Stuff may be broken, incomplete, or purely exploratory.

Think of it as:
- A personal playground  
- A scratchpad for experiments  
- A dumping ground for trials, failures, and wild ideas  

Nothing here should be considered production-ready.  
Use at your own risk.
